\frametitle{Main semantic properties}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Encapsulation \& atomic execution:\\	
	actors don't share state; \\
	process one message at a time, arrivals mid-computation need to be buffered;
	\item Fairness\\
	every actor makes progress, every message is delivered eventually; \\
	assumes fair scheduler; \\
	\textrightarrow actor cannot stall entire program
	\item Location transparency\\
	physical location not bound to identifier; \\
	\textrightarrow (hidden) migration possible, i.e. {\it mobility}
	\textrightarrow allows load-balancing, efficiency optimization
\end{itemize}

%\item in reality, some aspects aren't implemented faithfully (for efficiency, complexity)
%\item concerns about scalability \& performance
