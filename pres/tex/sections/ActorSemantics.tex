REWORK - update, detail? one frame per property?
\begin{itemize}
\item Actor semantics have three main properties
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Encapsulation \& atomicity
	(actors don't share state, process one message at a time)
	\item Fairness
	(every actor makes progress, every message delivered eventually)
	\item Location transparency
	(physical location not bound to identifier, hidden migration)
	\end{itemize}
\item in reality, some aspects aren't implemented faithfully (for efficiency, complexity)
\item concerns about scalability \& performance
\end{itemize}
